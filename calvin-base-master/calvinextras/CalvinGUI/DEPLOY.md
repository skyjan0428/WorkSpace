## Deploying Web GUI to server

The jake-file `Jakefile` contains a command `push-release` that will do the heavy lifting:

    # Example invocation
    JAKE_KEYPATH=$HOME/.ssh/calvin_web.key \
    JAKE_DEPLOYPATH=user@host:/var/www/html/ \
    jake push-release

The environment `JAKE_KEYPATH` and `JAKE_DEPLOYPATH` variables must be set.

- `JAKE_KEYPATH` points to a private key to access the server
- `JAKE_DEPLOYPATH` is a destination path suitable for use with `ssh`, consisting of 
  - _user_: the user on the host
  - _host_: the address of the server

The process will take a couple of minutes (rebuilding and optimizing the code, pushing the cappuccino framework, etc.).

## Creating a stand-alone version for Calvin distro

The jake-file `Jakefile` contains a command `calvin-release` that will do the heavy lifting:

    # Example invocation
    CONFIG=Release jake calvin-release

The output will be in the GUI directory in the Build directory. If CONFIG is not given, the Objj compiler will default to debug.

## Release versions

If deploying for use with a Master release of Calvin, define `CALVIN_VERSION` when issuing the above command. If `CALVIN_VERSION` is not specified the required version will be set to the latest commit hash.

    # Example invocation
    CALVIN_VERSION=0.7 \
    JAKE_KEYPATH=$HOME/.ssh/calvin_web.key \
    JAKE_DEPLOYPATH=user@host:/var/www/html/ \
    jake push-release


## Notes

- Close XCode before deploying or bad things will happen
